This project is to figure out how to retrieve the video contents from the websites and then parse the content into a video file that can be saved to local machine.
This is for experimenting purpose only for educating use. 
The potentical solution is to use Javascript and Python.

As I understand a little more of it, to download video files like .mps is quite simple by using curl commanbd.
However more commonly we are watching stream videos, or live video broadcast, this makes it difficult to get a video file content, 

Therefore the project is going to focus on getting the video object from streaming video plays. 
Good luck!
